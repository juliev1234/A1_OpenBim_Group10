### The process of creating the tool
Creating the tool was quite difficult because our programming skills weren’t that good. It was challenging to find out how to present the tool. In the beginning we weren’t quite sure which platform we wanted to display the extracted information on. Therefore, the start process was confusing because the red thread was missing, and the script created were looking at too much stuff. However, in the end we found a good solution that showed the created plot, and we made a cool webpage.

### The output of the tool.
The output was in the end decided to be displayed on a webpage. The tool gave a good overview of the displayed data. The feedback from the peer review indicated that the output of the tool was well modelled. The groups thought the website was quite impressive and had a good interface. They agreed that the website would be improved if it was possible to interact with the plot and click on the walls. 

## Process of developing the tool

### Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
We are not sure what we will do for our theses yet. It seems like OpenBIM and the use of python have many options that can be useful to make a program run automatically instead of doing many things manually. However, it is also quite difficult, and therefore, we don’t expect to use this in our theses at this time.

### Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
In the beginning it was a bit unclear how to decide which use case to choose. It would be nice to have a guided assignment to understand IFC-files better, and therefore, less choices in the use case. It was challenging to decide between the many use cases while understanding what IFC is. Furthermore, we didn’t know what would be possible for us to program later on, why it was difficult for us to choose a use case.

### Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so, which ones would you leave out?
Less tools! Only introduce one programming language e.g. only python and excel to develop the tools and then Blender for 3D understanding of the IFC-file. Blender was a nice tool to have to get a visual overview of the building.



## Output of the tool

### Did the tool address the use case you identified?
The tool only addressed part of the original use case. As the use case was very broad in the beginning, we had to narrow it down to be more realistic regards to the workload and skills.

### Was the use case well modelled?
We think that our use case was well modelled. However, we might not have carried it out the way we originally wanted since our programming skills were not good enough. 

### Was the project clearly scoped?
The project was clearly scoped to be a helpful preparation for a FEM program from the beginning where we formed and wrote down our use case.  However, as the project was in progress, we shorted down the workload which made the final product more general. This is also an advantage in the development of other use cases and if it is to be used by other students. 

## Future

### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis? Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professional life in the next 10 years?
As written before, we are not sure what we will do for our theses yet. However, we don’t expect to use OpenBIM tools in our theses at this time. It does seem like OpenBIM has many good qualities and possibilities, and therefore, it has been nice to get an introduction to OpenBIM and IFC-files so that we might use it in the future. 

## Improvements

From the peer review feedback, we got some more ideas on what to improve. For example, it would be cool if the program not only looked at self-weight but also weight from the other structural elements. Furthermore, it would be cool if the program could take into account whether the structural elements were defined incorrectly and tell the user.
