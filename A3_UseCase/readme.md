## 3A: Analyse use case

### 1) Goal
To support the user to calculate/find the topology of the project in order to carry out a structural analysis.

### 2)	Model Use (Bim Uses)
The chosen use case is structural analysis. In the structural analysis, the load bearing elements and their dimensions and positions in the building can be found using IFC concepts. This information can be used to create the topology of the elements and create a structural design model. This model can then be analysed using a FEM-program. It is assessed that the following Mapping BIM uses are needed: 01 Existing conditions modelling, 07 Design review and 08 Structural Analysis. The use case categories can be seen in the table.
